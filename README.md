# redis-clone

A simple Redis clone written in C++. This is just a fun project for me to learn C++ and Redis, though I do have some plans for this project.

## Roadmap

(this is not in order of when I plan to implement it)

- [ ] Add support for [RESP](https://redis.io/docs/reference/protocol-spec/)
- [ ] Add support for other types (for now it only supports strings)
- [ ] Add support for other commands (for now it only supports `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`, and `PING`)
